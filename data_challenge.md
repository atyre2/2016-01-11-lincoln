## Extra data challenge

The data for this challenge comes from the [UV-B Monitoring and Research program](http://uvb.nrel.colostate.edu/UVB/uvb_dataAccess.jsf), funded by USDA and housed at Colorado State University. 

### Assignment

The file for this weeks assignment will be a commented R script. The file should be saved with a name like `yourlastname_week7.R`, and uploaded as an attachment. At the top of the file write 
the week number and your name on one line with a comment code. If none of that makes sense, go watch the start of [the video for subsetting vectors](https://youtu.be/LZB3x6hNZ9M). 

Write the code to do the following:

1. some stuff

I should be able to run your script from the main directory of the project created in week 6 using `source("code/yourlastname_extraData.R")` from a clean start of R. To test your code to make sure it works without errors, first click on the Session menu, and choose `Restart R`. Then open your file and click the `source` button in the top right corner. 
 
This challenge is due on Friday of Week XX at 5 pm. Late assignments will receive 
a score of zero unless prior approval is granted.

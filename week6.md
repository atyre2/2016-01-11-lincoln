## Week 6: Reproducible research with R

As with previous weeks, type your answers into a text file and submit that. You can use the RStudio editor to make your text file. 

### Introduction to R/RStudio

* [Video for Intro to RStudio](https://youtu.be/FNrCxTSzq6s)
* [Video for Intro to R](https://youtu.be/WHQuKwBv4YA)
* [Short video on comparing floating point numbers](https://youtu.be/a4NLV680uuo)
* [Reading for the Lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/01-rstudio-intro.html)
* Do all 4 challenges, and submit the output of the following R commands in your text file:

```
ls() # show me the contents of your workspace
history(20) # show me the last 20 lines of code executed
installed.packages() # show me that you've got the right packages installed! 
```

### Project management with RStudio

* [Video for project management](https://youtu.be/ahcX9XZE1s8)
* [Reading for the Lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/02-project-intro.html)
* Do the Creating a self-contained project challenge, Challenge 1, and Challenge 2. Nothing to turn in, but you need all of those done for the rest of the lessons to work.
* Ignore the tip to use the ProjectTemplate package; it is an interesting idea that isn't mature enough yet to use. 

### Seeking Help

* [Video for getting help](https://youtu.be/F7Z94CqKzzI)
* [Reading for the lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/03-seeking-help.html) 
* Do both challenges -- turn in as a text file. 

### Data Structures

* [Video on Data types and vectors](https://youtu.be/vCX6hnx4dEE)
* [Video with more Vectors and Factors](https://youtu.be/TOoQoysT9is)
* [Video on Matrices and Lists](https://youtu.be/HOp6SY5tvxw)
* [Reading for the lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/04-data-structures-part1.html)
* For challenge 1, copy the code you used to create and test the three types of vectors into your answer file.
* Do challeges 2, 3 and 4.

### Assignment

Challenges are due on Friday of Week 6 \(Feb 19\) at 5 pm. Late assignments will receive 
a score of zero unless prior approval is granted. Your answers should be 
entered into a plain text file. At the top of the file write 
the week number and your name on one line. Leave a blank line, and type the 
name of the lesson. For each challenge in the lesson, on one line, give the 
title of the Challenge. On the next line, enter your answer. This may be 
simply a number in the case of a multiple choice question, or perhaps a couple 
lines of commands or text. Separate challenges with blank lines.
The file should be saved with a name like `yourlastname_week6.txt`.

Challenges are due on Friday of Week 2 at 5 pm. Late assignments will receive 
a score of zero unless prior approval is granted. Your answers should be 
entered into a plain text file. At the top of the file write 
the week number and your name on one line. Leave a blank line, and type the 
name of the lesson. For each challenge in the lesson, on one line, give the 
title of the Challenge. On the next line, enter your answer. This may be 
simply a number in the case of a multiple choice question, or perhaps a couple 
lines of commands or text. Separate challenges with blank lines.

## Week 3: Automating tasks with the shell

During this week we will introduce pipes and filters, loops and shell scripts.
I will live code these sessions, so there will be no recordings available until
after Tuesday's synchronous session.

The page with the index to all shell lessons, and additional resource links
[is here](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).

### Pipes and filters 

* [lesson page](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/03-pipefilter.html)
* Do the following challenges: What does sort -n do?, What does < mean?, 
    what does >> mean?, Piping commands together, Pipe reading comprehension

### Loops

* Do the following challenges: variables in loops, Saving to a file in a loop part I and II,
    

### Shell Scripts

Challenges are due on Friday of Week 3 at 5 pm. Late assignments will receive 
a score of zero unless prior approval is granted. Your answers should be 
entered into a plain text file. At the top of the file write 
the week number and your name on one line. Leave a blank line, and type the 
name of the lesson. For each challenge in the lesson, on one line, give the 
title of the Challenge. On the next line, enter your answer. This may be 
simply a number in the case of a multiple choice question, or perhaps a couple 
lines of commands or text. Separate challenges with blank lines.

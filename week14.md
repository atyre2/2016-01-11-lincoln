## Week 14: Metadata

See [the bottom of this page](#assignment) for this weeks Challenge. 

### Preparation

This week's videos and exercises are based on educational materials from the [DataONE project](https://www.dataone.org). We will do a little bit of R, so create a new project in RStudio for week 13. The data files needed for the challenge can be [downloaded here](https://www.dataone.org/sites/all/documents/DataFiles_L04L05L07L08.zip) as a zip archive. Extract the files into the data subdirectory of your RStudio project directory. These are Microsoft Excel files, so cannot be directly read into R \(easily\). Part of this weeks challenge is getting the data into R so you can make some plots!

### Introduction to Metadata

* [Video introduction](https://youtu.be/UW7iO427dME)
* [One page handout for this lesson](https://www.dataone.org/sites/all/documents/L07_Metadata_Handout_FINAL.pdf).

### Assignment

There are two parts to this week's challege. First, 
[download this assignment](assets/L07_L08_Exercise_student.pdf). There are 5 activities in the PDF. Provide the your answers to each of the five activities as a TEXT FILE. These activities focus on the data files downloaded in week 13. Save this file as Yourlastname_week14.txt. 

In the second part of the assignment, search (the data archive at www.dataone.org)[https://www.dataone.org/] for data relevant to your research. Choose one dataset. In the text file, describe the dataset you have found using the 6 questions: what, who, when, where, how, and why. Under what, be sure to describe the variables that are in the data including units. If there are good metadata available this should be copy and paste! Can you actually download and use the dataset? Is it in Tidy data format?
 
This challenge is due on Friday of Week 14 \(April 15\) at 5 pm. Late assignments will receive 
a score of zero unless prior approval is granted.

## Week 16: Random sampling

See [the bottom of this page](#assignment) for this weeks Challenges. The [index page for the sampling lesson is somewhat incomplete](http://atyre2.github.io/sampling-novice).

### Preparation

This week's videos and exercises are brand spankin' newly created by me! Lots of mistakes to find.  

### The data life cycle

* [Reading and challenge](http://atyre2.github.io/sampling-novice/01-sampling.html). This has a bit of motivational text. Do the "Is it available?" challenge in the data archiving section.

### Loading spatial data

This lesson uses some spatial datasets so this page describes how to get them into R.

* [Video for Mac users](https://unlvideo.techsmithrelay.com/ODRL) demonstrating how to get the data downloaded in the correct directory structure. Your mac is a bit 
  too helpful without some adjustments. 
* [Instructions for loading spatial data](http://atyre2.github.io/sampling-novice/03-sampling.html)


### Random sampling in space

* [Reading and challenges](http://atyre2.github.io/sampling-novice/04-sampling.html)

There are 3 challenges to turn in this week. All of them are on [this page](http://atyre2.github.io/sampling-novice/04-sampling.html)
 
Copy and paste the R code solving each challenge into a text file saved as week15_yourlastname.R and attach that file to your submission. This Assignment is due on Friday of Week 16 \(April 29\) at 5 pm. Late assignments will receive a score of zero unless prior approval is granted.

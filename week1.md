## Week 1: Getting started

During this week we will post introductions, setup software, start thinking 
about project organization and begin learning about the Unix Shell. At the end 
of each lesson page there are "Challenge Questions". They look like this:

> ## Challenge Title {.challenge}
>
> Description of a single challenge.
> There may be several challenges.

Each week I will ask you to submit your answers to these challenges to Blackboard. 
Your answers should be entered into a plain text file. At the top of the file write 
the week number and your name on one line. Leave a blank line, and type the name of the
lesson. For each challenge in the lesson, on one line, give the title
of the Challenge. On the next line, enter your answer. This may be simply a number
in the case of a multiple choice question, or perhaps a couple lines of commands or text. 
Seperate challenges with blank lines. 

### Posting introductions

Go to the course discussion board on BlackBoard, enter the "introductions" forum, 
click "Create thread", and introduce yourself! What are you doing at NU? Please 
also post a photograph of yourself. This is mostly for my benefit. Otherwise,
we meet on campus somewhere and I've no idea why you know me but I don't know 
you! 

### Setup software

Before the first synchronous session on Tuesday, January 12, please install all the 
[software listed on the main course website](index.html#setup).
